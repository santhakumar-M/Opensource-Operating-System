# EXP NO : 5 Set a Cron job
### AIM:
To set a Cron job.
### PROCEDURE:
1. EdiHng crontab
The first line [root@servera:~]# crontab -e harry edits the crontab for the user
harry. The crontab command is used to manage cron jobs for users. The -e opHon specifies
that the user's crontab file should be opened in a text editor. In this case, since the user execuHng
the command is root (the system administrator), they are able to edit the crontab for another
user (harry).
2. Adding a cron job
The line 30 12 * * * /bin/bash /home/harry/backup.sh is most likely the line
that was added to the crontab file. This line defines a new cron job.
Cron jobs use a specific format to define the schedule and command to be executed. The format is:
minute hour day of month month day of week command
Each field is separated by a space and defines a specific value or range of values. An asterisk (*) in
any field represents "all possible values" for that field.
In this case, the cron job is defined as follows:
• Minute: 30 - This means the job will run at the 30th minute of every hour.
• Hour: 12 - This means the job will run at 12 o'clock.
• Day of month: * - This wildcard symbol indicates that the job will run on every day of the
month.
• Month: * - This wildcard symbol indicates that the job will run in every month of the year.
• Day of week: * - This wildcard symbol indicates that the job will run on every day of the
week (Monday through Sunday).
• Command: /bin/bash /home/harry/backup.sh - This specifies the command to
be executed. The /bin/bash part tells the system to use the Bash shell to execute the
script. The /home/harry/backup.sh part specifies the path to the script that will be
run.
3. Saving the crontab
ARer ediHng the crontab file, the user would typically save and exit the text editor. Since we don't
see the specific commands used to save the file, I can't say for sure how this was done in this
instance.
In summary, these commands set up a cron job to run a script named /home/harry/
backup.sh at 12:30 every day. The script itself is not shown in the image so it is impossible to
know what the script does.
